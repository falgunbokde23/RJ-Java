Web Development
SpringApplication
Application events and listeners
Admin features
Externalized Configuration
Properties Files
YAML Support
Type-safe Configuration
Logging
Security
Web Development
It is well suited Spring module for web application development. We can easily create a self-contained HTTP server using embedded Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow. We can use the spring-boot- starter-web module to start and running application quickly.

SpringApplication
It is a class which provides the convenient way to bootstrap a spring application which can be started from main method. You can call start your application just by calling a static run() method.

public static void main(String[] args){  
    SpringApplication.run(className.class, args);  
}  
Application Events and Listeners
Spring Boot uses events to handle variety of tasks. It allows us to create factories file that are used to add listeners. we can refer it by using ApplicationListener key.

Always create factories file in META-INF folder like: META-INF/spring.factories

Admin Support
Spring Boot provides the facility to enable admin related features for the application. It is used to access and manage application remotely. We can enable it by simply using spring.application.admin.enabled property.

Externalized Configuration
Spring Boot allows us to externalize our configuration so that we can work with the same application in different environments. Application use YAML files to externalize configuration.

Properties Files
Spring Boot provides rich set of Application Properties. So, we can use that in properties file of our project. Properties file is used to set properties like: server-port = 8082 and many others. It helps to organize application properties.

YAML Support
It provides convenient way for specifying hierarchical configuration. It is a superset of JSON. The SpringApplication class automatically support YAML. It is successful alternative of properties.

Type-safe Configuration
Strong type-safe configuration is provided to govern and validate the configuration of application. Application configuration is always a crucial task which should be type-safe. We can also use annotation provided by this library.

Logging
Spring Boot uses Common logging for all internal logging. Logging dependencies are managed by default. We should not change logging dependencies, if there is no required customization is needed.

Security
Spring Boot applications are spring bases web applications. So, it is secure by default with basic authentication on all HTTP endpoints. A rich set of Endpoints are available for develop a secure Spring Boot application.
