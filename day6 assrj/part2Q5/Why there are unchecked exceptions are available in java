Why there are unchecked exceptions are available in java if not complain by
compiler. Why this segregation of checked and unchecked exceptioins

is, as it states, at runtime. A checked exception must be handled either by re-throwing 
or with a try catch block, whereas an unchecked isn't required to be 
handled
