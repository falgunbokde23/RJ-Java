Ques 3: Can you prevent serializing a subclass object when super type is serializable

Ans:-

If the superclass is Serializable, then by default, every subclass is serializable. Hence, 
even though subclass doesnâ€™t implement Serializable interface( and if its superclass implements
 Serializable), then we can serialize subclass object.
