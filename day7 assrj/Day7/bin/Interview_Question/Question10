Ques 10: Name some important Checked Exceptions you have used in your implementations

Ans:-

 Checked exceptions are the subclass of the Exception class. These types of exceptions need to be handled
 during the compile time of the program. These exceptions can be handled by the try-catch block or by 
 using throws keyword otherwise the program will give a compilation error.

 ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException etc are the examples of the checked exceptions.
