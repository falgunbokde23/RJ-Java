Ques 1: What is serialization? When we use it try to explain with any real use-case

Ans:-

Serialization:-

	Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or 
	transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order
	 to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.
	   
   
   Real time example:-
   
   You can take any example as realtime such as that you are going to visit your home after 20 yrs and 
   you want the same things,same arrangements and many more things which you left 20 yrs ago in same 
   condition as where u left.. then it is serialization. it means you saved the state of things which 
   make them serialize.
