Ques 5: Why serialVersionUID is important in class definitions. When it becomes
important to define in objects. What is JVM behavior in case you do not define
serialVersionUID for your object


Ans:-

 - Suppose a person who is in the UK and another person who is in India, are going to perform serialization
	 and deserialization respectively. In this case, to authenticate that the receiver who is in India is the 
	 authenticated person, JVM creates a unique ID which is known as SerialVersionUID.
 
 - Serialization at the time of serialization, with every object sender side JVM will save a Unique
	  Identifier. JVM is responsible to generate that unique ID based on the corresponding .class file which 
	  is present in the sender system.
