Ques 9: What happens when method returns something from try block, will finally be
executed in that case?

Ans:-

	-Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method. 
	 The finally block will always execute even an exception occurred or not in Java. 
	 
 
  -If we call the System. exit() method explicitly in the finally block then only it will not be executed. 
  There are few situations where the finally will not be executed like JVM crash, power failure, software
   crash and etc. Other than  these conditions, the finally block will be always executed.
