Ques 4: Difference between Iterator and ListIterator

Ans:-

 Iterator:-
 
- Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.
- Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.
- Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.
- Cannot modify or replace elements present in Collection
- Cannot add elements and it throws ConcurrentModificationException.
- Certain methods of Iterator are next(), remove() and hasNext().



ListIterator:-
-Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.
-Can only traverse List and not the other two.
-It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any 
  time while traversing List.
 -We can modify or replace elements with the help of set(E e).
 -Can easily add elements to a collection at any time.
 -Certain methods of ListIterator are next(), previous(), hasNext(), hasPrevious(), 
  add(E e).
