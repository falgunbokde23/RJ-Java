Ques 5: Explain the real situation use of HashMap, HashSet and LinkedList collections

Ans:-


HashMap:-

Hashmaps are probably the most commonly used implementation of the concept of a map. They 
allow arbitrary objects to be associated with other arbitrary objects. This can be very 
useful for doing things like grouping or joining data together by some common attribute.

HashSet:- 

A Java HashSet class represents a set of elements (objects). It does not guarantee the
 order of elements. It constructs a collection that uses a hash table for storing elements.
  It contains unique elements. It inherits the AbstractSet class. It also implements the 
  Set interface. It uses a technique to store elements is called hashing. HashSet uses
   HashMap internally in Java.
   
   
 LinkedList	:-
 
 Previous and next page in a web browser – We can access the previous and next URL searched in a web browser by pressing the back and next buttons since they are linked as a linked list.
 Music Player – Songs in the music player are linked to the previous and next songs.
